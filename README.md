# Written Analysis of Challenge 1 Results

## Overview/Purpose of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to see how different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

### Overview
Using the Kickstarter data from Module 1, I created a table showing theater kickstarter outcomes based on launch date. With this table, I was able to create a line chart to visualize this data. In addition, I created a table showing outcomes based on goal and a line chart to better visualize the data.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The line chart clearly demonstrates that the May had the most successful theater outcomes (111). The least successful month was December with 31 successful outcomes. 
May also had the most failed theater outcomes (52) followed closely by July and October with 50 failed outcomes each.
January had the most canceled theater outcomes (7). The rest of the year was between 2-4 canceled outcomes except for October which had no canceled theater outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The line chart for the outcomes based on goals shows that projects that had a goal of less than 1000 had the highest percentage of success (76%). This is followed closely by projects with a goal between 1000 and 4999 (73%).
The lowest percentage of success was projects with goals between 45,000 and 49,000 (0%). This is followed by projects with goals greater than 50,000 (17%).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I encountered during this assignment was while filling out the Outcomes Based on Goals table. Because of all the criteras each cell had, it was easy to make a mistake while typing and getting the wrong number or getting an error. To overcome this challenge, I had to be very careful while typing and double check my formulas as I went.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

One conclustion I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that May is the best time to launch and the second best time is June. Another conclusion I can draw from my results is that the canceled theater outcomes were constant throughout the year.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The Outcomes Based on Goals line chart shows that projects that had a goal of less than 1000$ had the highest success rate.

### What are some limitations of this dataset? 
Some limitations of this data set is that we only have some data from 2009-2017. Since it is now 2021, it is hard to say if this data is still applicable. We also know that this isn't all the projects that happened during this time, so the data could be showing us skewed results.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a bar chart to better see the Theater Outcomes vs Launch. It would show a more clear picture of each month's outcomes.
